# Discord Creators' Bot

We're a Discord community exclusively for content creators: youtubers, streamers and alike! Here, we give you the chance to meet fellow creators, share content and opinions, ask for advice and support, offer your commission services or ask for commissions, collaborate, and much more! Any type of creator is welcome: from gamers to music producers, commentators, reactors, streamers, music labels, animators, art makers, documentarians, science channels, and the list goes on...

## Reporting Issues

We currently support two separate ways to report any issues and bugs with the bot. 

1. The first is the **/report** command within Discord. The command will ask for a description of the error and then promptly alert the developers. 
2. The second is to open an [issue](https://github.com/ThatsLiamS/Discord-Creators-bot/issues) on the GitHub repository. Upon opening a new GitHub Issue, fill out all the relevant fields and submit the report.


## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! A massive benefit of being an open-source bot is the whole community coming togetherto contribute and improve the bot.

See `contributing.md` for ways to get started. Please adhere to this project's `code of conduct`.
